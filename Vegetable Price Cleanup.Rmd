## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#import libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
#install.packages("zoo")
library(zoo)
```

```{r}
#import dataset
dataset <- read_csv("Prices.csv")

dataset 
```
```{r}
#get a usable dataframe that indexes by date
data <- dataset %>% select(Date, Commodity, Average) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = c("Commodity"),  values_from = c("Average")) 
data

```
```{r}
#this dataset is now usable by item but there are many rows with missing values. We have to decide which commodities are useful for time series

#first we need to know what the proportions of NAs are in each column
naProp <- data %>% summarise(across(everything(), ~ mean(is.na(.))))

#using a list of names of these columns we can select only the ones that have a less than 5% 
df <- data %>% select(names(naProp)[naProp <= 0.05])

#we now have a working dataframe with columns that we can draw more reliable inferences from
df

```
```{r}
#We still need to address the missing NAs within the dataframe

#we can use cubic spline interpolation to fill in the missing values
df <- df %>% mutate_if(~ is.numeric(.) & any(is.na(.)), ~ na.spline(.), .vars = vars(-Date))

#double check that all nas are gone
df %>% summarise(across(everything(), ~ mean(is.na(.))))

#success, we have a usable dataframe
df

```
```{r}
#export the df to csv
#write_csv(df, "Cleaned Food Prices.csv")


```
